In this repo I created javascript PB questions and solutions:
------------------------------------------------------------


1. Use an if-else statement to print out the message you get if you want to attend a children-only cinema by telling child's age. The message should print the film assigned to viewer's age. This week films are (categorized by age):
 
 * Film: "Ponyo" is for 2 years old up to 5 years old. 
 * Film: "My Neighbor Totoro" is for 6 years old up to 10 years old.
 * Film: "Harry Potter" for 11 years old up to 15 years old.
 * print message for clients older than 15 years old.

 ** e.g. if age is 10 --> it prints: -->  "The film for you today is My Neighbor Totoro!"




2. There is a "sleep" study going on at a clinic and they are working with 5 study-subjects: "Joe", "Jane"; "lila"; "Pepe" and  "Gina". Write a function named "hoursSleep" with an "if-else statement" that prints who sleeps more hours each day once doctors pass the data of the hours each subject slept. It should run like this:

** example: 
hoursSleep(4, 5, 8, 9, 7); // -->> "Pepe slept today the most! 9 hours"

  


   
3. Create a multiple case switch program where you can write different food items from the supermarket and it will print if they are fruits or not. (Hint: a list of fruit cases must be therefore included...).

** e.g. if we run banana --> it prints: -->"banana is a real fruit!";
** e.g. if we run potato --> it prints: --> "Potato is not a fruit" ;        




4. Create a javascript program with switch statement where you write the name of a city and it prints something that city has. 

** e.g. if city is Malaga --> it prints: --> "There are Palm trees in Malaga"
** e.g. if city is San FRancisco--> it prints: --> "San Francisco has the Golden Gate"




5. Write a loop (using 2 arrays as variables), that prints every weekday menu like this: 
   
* MENU: Monday, we have pizza for lunch at the canteen
* MENU: Tuesday, we have beans-pot for lunch at the canteen
* MENU: Wednesday, we have veggie-tacos for lunch at the canteen
* MENU: Thursday, we have salad and fish for lunch at the canteen
* MENU: Friday, we have pasta for lunch at the canteen




6. Write a JavaScript program to print the following pattern: half a pine tree (N.B: use a nested for-loop!!).

* ^
* ^^
* ^^^
* ^^^^
* ^^^^^
* ^^^^^^
* ^^^^^^^
* ^^^^^^^^
* ^^^^^^^^^




7. Create a function, give it the name "result". It passes 2 integer numbers as arguments. Calculate the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are the same, then print triple their sum. 

** result(10, 10);  --> prints --> 60





8. Write a function that takes a string and prints its length. Write the same functions as an arrow function.

** example:
stringLength("Wooopiwoo"); --> prints --> The length of "Wooopiwoo" is: 9
stringLength("Hello, how are you?"); --> prints --> The length of "Hello, how are you?" is: 19




9. A fashion brand has designed a unisex jacket and it is going into production. If each size requires 20 cm more of fabric and the prototype "size M" requires 1.8 m. How many fabric rolls do we need to produce 50 jackets of each size, given that each roll has 40 meters? Sizes in production are XS, S, M, L, XL. YOu should round meter numbers and remember production can only buy full rolls!
 It should print as follows :
** e.g.  "The amount of fabric rolls needed is ... "
 
* Hint for sizes:
*   size: XS
*   size: S
*   size: M = 1.8 m
*   SIZE: L
*   size: XL


* BONUS 1: How many rolls of fabric do we need for the jacket's lining if each jacket lining requires 85% of the amount of the main fabric/per size? Calculate the total meters of lining for all jackets in production given that lining fabric rolls have 50 meters each. 

** i.e. It should print as follows : "The  amount of lining fabric rolls needed is ...


* BONUS 2: How many rolls do we need if the fabric is double width? Print it as a string and specify how many rolls are lining and how many are main fabric.

** e.g. "If fabric is double width: all jackets in production require ..."





10. The owner of a famous restaurant called "SuperSandwiches" has asked you to calculate important information about the restaurant's sales. THe restaurant has 3 shifts : morning, afternoon and night shit. It is open 7 days a week.
 Create an object called restaurantSales and calculate: 

* how many sandwiches did we sell on average per day? and everyday (in total)?
* how many sandwiches did we sell on average per morning?
* how many sandwiches did we sell on average per evening?
* which was the best day to sell sandwiches?
* which shift sold best on the best day selling sandwiches?
* which was the worst day to sell sandwiches?
